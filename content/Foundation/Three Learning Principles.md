-  **Occam's Razor**  
	The simplest model that fits the data is also the most plausible.
- **Axiom of Non-falsifiablity**  
	If the outcome of an experiment has no chance of falsifying a particular proposition, then the result of that experiment does not provide evidence one way or another toward the truth of the proposition.
- **Sample Bias**  
	If the data is sampled in a biased way, learning will produce a similarly biased outcome.
- **Data Snooping**  
	If a data set has affected any step in the learning process, its ability to asses the outcome has been compromised.
    1. Avoid data snooping
	    Data that is going to be used evaluate the final performance should be 'locked in a safe' and only brought after the final hypothesis has been decided.
	2. Account for data snooping
		If you have use a data set more than once, keep track of the level of contamination and treat the reliability of your performance estimates in light of this contamination.
