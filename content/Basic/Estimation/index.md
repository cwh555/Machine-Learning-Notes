Estimation refers to the process of inferring the values of model parameters based on observed data.

This section introduces methods for estimating model parameters from data. Two common approaches are covered:
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):** Estimates parameters by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data.
- **Maximum A Posteriori (MAP):** Extends MLE by incorporating a prior distribution on the parameters, effectively introducing regularization.
