title: Overfitting
---
Overfitting occurs when a learning algorithm fits the training data too closely, capturing not only the underlying patterns but also the noise. As a result, the model performs well on the training set but poorly on unseen data. This is a central issue in machine learning, especially when using complex models with limited data.

Key symptoms of overfitting include:

- Training error much lower than validation or test error.
- Model complexity is unnecessarily high for the task.
- Poor generalization to new data.

To address overfitting, we often rely on techniques several techniques as the followings.
