## Welcome
Welcome to my machine learning notes website! During my summer break before my sophomore year, I read several foundational books, including but not limited to : 

  <li><em>Learning from Data</em></li>
  <li><em>Deep Learning</em></li>
  <li><em>Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation</em></li>

I took extensive notes using Obsidian, and I had an impulse to make them open on the Internet. Here, you can explore my organized notes and insights from these readings.

  > Sorry for the slow updatesâ€”my brain sometimes has more tabs open than my browser. Completed topics will be listed on the [[Abouts]] page.
