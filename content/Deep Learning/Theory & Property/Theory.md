## Universal Approximation Theorem
A feedforward network with a linear output layer and at least one hidden layer with any "squashing" activation function can approximate any Borel measurable function from one finite-dimensional space to another with any desired non-zero amount of error, provided that the network is given enough hidden units.

## Cover's Theorem on the separability of patterns
A complex pattern-classification problem cast in a high-dimensional space nonlinearly is more likely to be linearly separable than in a low-dimensional space.
